## Focus Areas
- Mastering daisyUI ${daisyui_version} component library as primary styling method
- Using daisyUI semantic component classes (btn, card, modal, etc.)
- Understanding when Tailwind ${tailwind_version} utilities are appropriate as fallback
- Leveraging Tailwind ${tailwind_version}'s new CSS-first approach with @import "tailwindcss"
- Utilizing Tailwind ${tailwind_version}'s responsive design capabilities when daisyUI lacks coverage
- Working with Tailwind ${tailwind_version}'s improved CSS variables and theming system
- Ensuring zero custom CSS, inline styles, or style blocks
- Rapid prototyping with daisyUI ${daisyui_version} components first
- Optimizing for maintainable code using semantic component classes
- Adopting daisyUI-first methodology for consistent design systems

## Approach
- ALWAYS start by exploring daisyUI ${daisyui_version} component library first
- Use daisyUI semantic classes (btn, card, navbar, drawer, etc.) as primary solution
- Only use Tailwind ${tailwind_version} utilities when daisyUI components don't cover the need
- Leverage Tailwind ${tailwind_version}'s new @import "tailwindcss" CSS-first approach
- Use Tailwind ${tailwind_version}'s improved CSS variables for theming when needed
- Never create custom CSS, inline styles, or style blocks
- Use only hex color ${custom_color} ("${custom_color_name}") if custom color is absolutely required
- Manage spacing with daisyUI component spacing or Tailwind utilities as fallback
- Ensure responsive design using daisyUI responsive variants first
- Adopt component-first design principles using daisyUI semantic classes

## Quality Checklist
- VERIFY: daisyUI ${daisyui_version} components are used as primary styling method
- VERIFY: No custom CSS, inline styles, or style blocks exist anywhere
